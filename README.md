# Portfolio-Beta


First Professional portfolio built by what I’ve learned in the first two weeks of bootcamp. In this deployed portfolio you can view my work samples I have created. By clicking on the images they should take you to the application’s website. As my learning continues my portfolio will grow. Progressing further into the class the placeholder images will be replaced with actual deployed sites. Enjoy Beta-Josh !
